###### Journal Entries

**30th of October 2023** - Beginning of Fermentation Process. Started Journal. Documented Process and Ingredient List. Original Gravity read at 1.114. Potential ABV up to 15%. Concerned about floating yeasty boy, but it should break up or spread out after degas. SG 1.076 is first 1/3 sugar breakdown. Before bed, a giant floating yeasty boy on the surface of the wort had sunk, and the two separated yeast colonies sunk to the bottom into one large yeast colony, yay!

**31st of Oct** - I am concerned about the tea leaves. I didn't originally think about them possibly making the brew incredibly bitter. Also, I'm worried about the tea leave floating above the foam. I've decided against opening the fermenter daily for pitching nutrients. Most people online talk about how the benefit to staggering nutrients is offset by the risk of contamination. I chose to just yeet the 2 teaspoons today instead of spreading it out over the next week. Lightly agitated the fermenter in a circular motion being careful to not oxygenate the brew. About 1 hour after pitching nutrients we're having ~2.5 seconds in between each bubble. In the future, I should consider straining the loose tea of the wort or, if flavor is desirable, leaving it inside a teabag. About 3 hours after pitching nutrients, we're at the 24 hour mark. We're having ~2.1 seconds between each bubble. I'm not sure if plotting the change in CO2 generation can tell us anything useful but I'm interested in finding out. It's specifically the loose Hibiscus that is floating above the foam and not the iced passion tea.

**1st of Nov** - ~2.2 seconds between bubbles. Wort had about 1cm of foam, which had floated almost all of the hibiscus out of the brew. Gently rocked fermenter to drop the hibiscus through the foam. ~1.4 second between bubbles after agitation. The fermenter is giving off a strong Prickly Pear scent. The hibiscus and some of the tea floated above the foam again. I think this is going to be a constant struggle. I definitely need to consider putting tea in a weighted bag or steeper.

**14th of Nov** - About 17 seconds between each bubble. Some veiny looking buildup on the inside-sides of carboy. I think I should rack just to get it off the tea leaves. I don't want the bitter black tea flavors to be overwhelming. SG at 1.013. ABV is currently about 13.5. I racked to secondary. Tastes very sour. Reminds me of Bosque's Elephants on parade or some kind of gose.

**16th of Nov** - We have yeast rafts in secondary. fermentation didn't stall, fortunately. They look major sketch though. I can definitely understand why the subreddit has so many 'is this mold' posts.

**20th of Nov** - Fermentation process seems finished. Added 5-6ish ml of kieselsol to must to speed up clarification/fining. the color of this mead is beautiful, hopefully the kieselsol and chitosan don't strip it too much. Plan is to add chitosan 24hrs later (2pm on Tuesday, Nov 21st) and add K-Meta before bottling.

**21st of Nov** - Pitched 15mL of 1.5% chitosan about 4pm.

**22nd of Nov** - 1m 29.7seconds per bubble.

**24nd of Nov** - 3m 36.6seconds per bubble.

**25nd of Nov** - 3m 57.8seconds per bubble.

**28th of Nov** - The mead is getting pretty clear, I can see the individual LEDS in a mag light through the fermenter now. It's still a really dark purple color when a flashlight isn't shining through. With the flashlight shining through it looks a similar vibrant glowing red color as a health potion from any video game. It's quite beautiful to look at.
